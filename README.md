# Lok Sabha Election Analysis

This project involves an in-depth analysis of the general Lok Sabha election results. The dataset includes various attributes such as state, constituency, candidates, party, votes (EVM and postal), total votes, percentage of votes, and results.

## Key Objectives:
- Analyze voter behavior and electoral dynamics.
- Understand patterns and trends in election results.
- Visualize data for clear and impactful insights.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.

## Project Highlights:
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for accurate analysis.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key trends and patterns.
- Created visualizations to effectively communicate findings.
- Gained insights into voter behavior and the electoral process.

## Outcome:
In this data analysis project, we explored Lok Sabha election data and uncovered several interesting findings:


- EVM Votes and Total Votes Correlation: EVM Votes and Total Votes exhibit a strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient ≈ 0.999989). Most EVM votes cluster between 0.0 and 0.2 million, indicating lower EVM counts. Beyond 0.2 million votes, the frequency rapidly declines, with a few constituencies having high vote counts.
- Distribution of EVM Votes: The distribution of EVM votes is right-skewed, with a long right tail. Smaller regions have fewer votes, while larger states contribute significantly.
- Party Insights: Independent candidates dominate the dataset, followed by “None of the above” (NOTA). Major political parties (BSP, BJP, Congress) have fewer candidates but still play a significant role.
- Win-Loss Ratios: All India Trinamool Congress has the highest win ratio (about 60%). CPI(M) and INC show more losses than wins.
- Postal Votes Reliance: The Rashtriya Congress(J) Party relies most on postal votes, followed by Citizen Action Party-Sikkim.
Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into voting patterns and party dynamics during elections.
